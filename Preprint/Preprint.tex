\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Netball is a court-based team sport played predominantly among
Commonwealth nations, and has one of the highest participation rates for
team sports in Australia ({\textbf{???}}). As in many court-based team
sports, the goal of netball is to score more than the opposition.
Netball is, however, unique in that goals may only be scored by two
players on each team from within the `shooting circle' (i.e.~a half
circle around the goal with a 4.9m radius) at their end of the court
({\textbf{???}}). Traditionally, goals scored from within this circle
result in one `goal' or `point' for the team ({\textbf{???}}). In the
2020 season, Australia's national elite-level league (i.e.~Suncorp Super
Netball) made the decision to introduce the `Super Shot'
({\textbf{???}}). The Super Shot period provided teams an opportunity to
gain one- versus two-points for successful shots made from the `inner'
(i.e.~0m-3.0m) versus `outer' (i.e.~3.0m-4.9m), respectively, within the
final five minutes of each quarter ({\textbf{???}}). The league has
confirmed that the Super Shot rule will continue through the 2021 season
({\textbf{???}}).

Our analysis prior to the 2020 season ({\textbf{???}}) suggested that
the added value of the Super Shot (i.e.~two-points) aligned well with
the elevated risk of shooting from long range, and that teams may have
been able to maximise their scoring by taking a high proportion of Super
Shots. These findings were, however, based on shooting statistics from
past seasons where the Super Shot rule was not in effect -- and further
investigation of leagues where a `two-point rule' was in place
(i.e.~international Fast5) resulted in a much higher risk of missing
long-range shots ({\textbf{???}}). We hypothesised that the elevated
risk of missing long-range shots with a `two-point rule' in place stems
from situational factors, whereby defensive strategies were likely
altered to place a heavier emphasis on defending long-range shots
({\textbf{???}}). Data from the first full season with the Super Shot in
place provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the risk-reward value of
taking Super Shots with more valid shooting statistics. Further, these
data can provide a better foundation for simulating Super Shot periods
as a means to identify optimal shooting strategies. In the present study
we re-visited the question of whether the weighting of a 2:1 value is
appropriate based on the relative risk of missing a shot from the outer
versus inner circle during the Super Shot period using data from the
2020 season. Further -- we ran a series of simulations of the
five-minute Super Shot period, driven by shooting statistics from the
2020 season, in an attempt to identify optimal team-specific shooting
strategies for the proportion of Super Shots to take.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

Participants for this study included all players across the eight teams
from the 2020 season of the Australian national netball league
(i.e.~Suncorp Super Netball). Our study included publicly available,
pre-existing data held on the Suncorp Super Netball match centre
(\textbf{\emph{TODO: add link}}). An exemption from ethics review (and
subsequent waiver of individual consent) was granted by the Deakin
University Human Research Ethics Committee (\textbf{\emph{TODO: add
details}}).

\hypertarget{data-collection}{%
\subsection{Data Collection}\label{data-collection}}

We used the \{SuperNetballR\}\textbf{\emph{TODO: citation}} package to
extract match data from all regular season games during the 2020 Super
Netball Season via the Champion Data (official provider of competition
statistics) match centre. Within the match centre data -- all shots are
labelled with identifiers that place them in the inner or outer circle,
along with whether they were made or missed. Combined with the timestamp
of these events within quarters, we extracted team-specific shooting
statistics for: (i) the total number of shots taken; (ii) the number of
shots taken from the inner and outer circle; and (iii) the number of
made and missed shots from the inner and outer circle from each Super
Shot period across the season.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

Our study required estimating the probability of making versus missing
shots from the inner versus outer circle across the different teams. We
achieved this by defining a beta distribution in a probability density
function for the different circle zones, specified by:

\[f(x,a,b) = \frac{\Gamma(a+b)x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)} \]
where \(a\) and \(b\) represent the number of missed and made shots
within a circle zone, respectively; \(x\) is the probability of \(a\)
relative to \(b\); and \(\Gamma\) is the gamma function
({\textbf{???}}). Probability density functions were created for made
versus missed shots in the inner and outer circles for each team, as
well as all teams combined, to be used in subsequent analyses.

To examine the relative value of the 2:1 point ratio, we replicated the
approach from our previous work ({\textbf{???}}), but this time with
data from the 2020 season. Specifically, we compared the average
relative odds (± 95\% confidence intervals {[}CI{]}) of missing from the
outer versus inner circle during the Super Shot period. This was
achieved by dividing randomly sampled values (\emph{n} = 100,000) from
the probability density functions of the outer by those from the inner
circle at each sample iteration. This analysis was run using shooting
statistics from the entire league, as well as individual teams, to give
overall and team-specific risk-reward values for attempting Super Shots.
We also applied this analysis to opposition shooting statistics against
each team, providing a risk-reward value for attempting Super Shots
against an opponent. Theoretically, the relative odds of missing from
the outer to inner circle should match the ratio of points awarded
(i.e.~2:1) for the Super Shot to represent `good value.'

Next, we ran a series of simulations (\emph{n} = 1,000 each) of the
Power 5 period for each team altering the proportion of Super Shots
taken from 0\% to 100\%, at 10\% increments. We used the previously
calculated probabilities of making versus missing shots from within and
outside the outer circle during the Power 5 period from each team to
estimate the number of points the team may score during this period.
ACross each individual simulation, the total number of shots the team
would take and the proportion of these that were Super Shots was first
determined. We determined the mean and standard deviation for the number
of shots a team would expect during a Power 5 period based on overall
season statistics --- and the total number of shots for a team in an
individual simulation was randomly sampled from a truncated normal
distribution between the lower and upper 95\% CI limits of the
mean/standard deviation. The number of standard versus Super Shots being
taken within the simulation was then determined based on the current
Super Shot proportion (i.e.~from 0\% to 100\%) being examined. The
success (i.e.~make vs.~miss) of each individual standard or Super Shot
within the simulation was then determined by generating a random value
between 0 and 1, alongside a value sampled from the teams relevant
probability density function of making a shot from the relevant location
(i.e.~inner or outer circle). If the value sampled from the probability
density function was greater versus lower than the random value --- the
shot was considered successful versus unsuccessful, respectively. After
all individual shots were simulated, the total team score was summed
given the value of the made standard and Super shots. We examined the
scores achieved, and calculated the relative frequency of when the
minimum and maximum score was achieved for each team under the different
Super Shot proportions.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

The relative combined odds (± 95\% CIs) from all teams of missing from
the outer versus the inner circle across the entire match were 4.19
{[}3.88, 4.52{]}, and 4.04 {[}3.5, 4.6{]} versus 4.68 {[}4.07, 5.35{]}
in the standard and Super Shot periods, respectively. The relative odds
of missing from the outer versus inner circle across the individual
teams were relatively similar, with the exception of the Fever having
higher odds than the majority of teams across the entire match period
(see Figure \ref{fig:relativeOddsFig}). The relative odds (± 95\% CIs)
of missing from the outer versus inner circle during the Super Shot
Period were greater than 2:1 across all teams (see Figure
\ref{fig:relativeOddsFig}). No team appeared more or less effective in
elevating the risk of missing from the outer versus inner circle, with
mostly similar odds observed across all teams opponents in the various
periods of the quarter (see Figure \ref{fig:relativeOddsDefFig}).

\ldots standard sims results\ldots{}

Across all teams, as the proportion of Super Shots increased within
simulations both the maximum and minimum scores achievable increased and
decreased, respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:heatMapFig}). Both the
highest and lowest achievable scores for each team therefore came from
simulations using a high proportion of Super Shots (i.e.~\textgreater{}
80\%).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\ldots{}

Our analysis of shot statistics from the first season of the Super Shot
demonstrated an approximate four-times higher likelihood of missing from
the outer versus inner circle, irrespective of the match period
(i.e.~standard vs.~Super Shot period). While the 95\% CIs did overlap
between the two periods, a slightly higher risk of missing from the
outer versus inner circle was present in the Super Shot period. Our
present findings conflict with our earlier work from the 2018 Super
Netball season where we observed an approximate two-times higher risk of
missing from the outer versus inner circle --- and suggested that the
2:1 point ratio of the Super Shot represented `good' value relative to
the elevated risk of missing ({\textbf{???}}). Our present analysis
perhaps suggests this is no longer the case --- as the risk of missing
from the outer circle has approximately doubled, and now outweighs the
additional point value on offer. Across the different teams and periods,
We found in all but one instance that the risk of missing from the outer
versus inner circle was greater than two-times that of the inner circle.
The only instance where the 95\% CIs overlapped the 2:1 ratio was for
the Firebirds during the standard period. This specific case is
irrelevant, however, as the additional points were not available during
this time. The obvious difference between the present study and our
previous work ({\textbf{???}}) is the actual presence of the Super Shot
being on offer during the 2020 season. The elevated risk of missing from
the outer versus inner circle from the 2018 to 2020 Super Netball season
is similar to what we observed in originally comparing the 2018 Super
Netball to Fast5 (i.e.~where long range shots were also rewarded with
additional points) ({\textbf{???}}). Therefore, it seems apparent that
adding value to long-range shots in netball induces an adjustment in the
way either attacking and/or defensive teams play that elevates the risk
of missing long- versus close-range shots. There are a number of factors
that could be contributing to this elevated risk. The most likely reason
is an additional emphasis from defensive players on contesting
long-range shots given their added value, while the presence if the
Super Shot may also introduce psychological pressure on the shooting
player. A more thorough analysis of defensive strategies and
understanding shooting players perspectives around the Super Shot can
assist in understanding the mechanisms behind the elevated risk.

Remaining discussion points\ldots{}

Our approach in the present paper to simulate Super Shot scoring periods
differs to our original work ({\textbf{???}}). Previously, we allocated
an overall success rate to shots from the inner versus outer circle
(i.e.~if the sampled probability was 50\%, a total of 50\% of shots were
counted as successful). This contrasts to our present work, where we
sample and apply the probability of shot success to simulated individual
shots (i.e.~if the sampled probability is 50\%, the individual shot
being simulated has a 50\% probability of success). This approach likely
reflects an improvement on our analysis, better representing the
independent nature of shots in a netball match.

NOTES\ldots\{

The relative odds of missing from the outer versus inner circle suggests
that, on average, the value of the Super shot was outweighed by the
elevated risk of missing. We found that in all but one instance, the
risk of missing from the outer circle was greater than 2 times that of
the inner circle. The only case where the 95\% CIs overlapped 2 was for
the Firebirds during the standard period. This specific case is,
however, somewhat irrelevant as the additional points were not available
during this time. The mean relative odds across the dataset for our
versus inner circle ranged from X to X. These values are much higher
than our original analysis from a previous season, however align with
the fast 5 data which also included additional points for long range
shots. Together, these findings suggest that the presence of additional
points is in some way making these shots more difficult. It is still
difficult to infer what is causing this, with altered defensive
strategies and added psychological pressure remaining as valid potential
reasons. The risk of missing from the outer versus inner circle was also
elevated in standard scoring times compared to previous seasons. This
potentially suggests opposition teams may have adopted a general or
overall shift in defending long range shots, even when the additional
points were not available. Further analysis of gameplay or investigation
of coach/player strategy and perceptions is likely necessary to confirm
the factors contributing.

General approach and considerations around this. There are likely still
situations where the Super shot holds appropriate value. Despite the
average relative risk outweighing the additional point value in offer,
there may be situations where teams identify this as an appropriate
risk. For example, when trailing by a large margin with minimal time
remaining, the 1 point on offer for a standard shot may have very little
value to the trailing team. In this instance the Super shot becomes the
only option for a team to remain competitive. Our analysis also
considered overall team shooting statistics. The relative risk may
change for an individual specialist long range shooter, hence having the
ball in their hands in Super shot range may actually present a
relatively valuable opportunity. Hot hand too\ldots{}

Defensive relative risk data\ldots. The opposition also appears to be a
factor in the relative value of the Super shot. X teams appeared to
defend the shot better by defending this better than the inner circle,
particularly in the Super shot period. This further indicates an
emphasis on certain teams defensive strategy for the Super shot, which
could have made the long range harder, or by virtue of defending long
range positions making it easier for teams to get easier shots closer to
the post. Conversely, certain teams oppositions reduced their risk of
outer vs.~inner miss during the super shot period -- perhaps suggesting
that their defensive strategies were not as effective as their
oppositions strategy in generating `good' shots during the super shot
period. Despite the mean differences, the confidence intervals typically
overlapped. Again, these inferences can only be confirmed with more
detailed analysis of team strategy.

Discussion notes\ldots check paragraphs here

Our simulation data does, however, demonstrate potential value in using
the Super shot for certain teams and in certain scenarios. Times where
higher proportion of super shot was valuable? We incorporated variable
shot opportunity numbers based on league data, and hence the number of
shot opportunities varied across individual simulations for teams. This
was balanced, in that when teams received more shot opportunities, their
opposition received fewer. Across all simulations, the wining team
received more shots on x\% of times. This factor became more/less
evident across scenarios where a team took a higher proportion of super
shots, whereby the winning team had more shots in x\% of these
simulations. This firstly suggests that generating more shot
opportunities than your opponent is obviously beneficial, but
potentially awards you more flexibility when considering taking a
greater proportion of super shots.

Similarly, teams who were better with the Super shot fared better in
simulations with greater proportions of super shots, and vice versa for
teams that are worse. For example, the fever lost x\% of simulations
when they went heavy on the Super shot, vs.~X team who won x\% of
simulations when using a high \% proportion of super shots. This is not
surprising as the fever had the highest risk of missing from the outer
vs inner circle, particularly during Super shot periods. These findings
likely demonstrate a need for teams to play to their shooting strengths.

Looking at the margin summaries (mean +/- 95\% CI's) from each teams
competitive simulations across all opponents, certain strategies
appeared more or less favourable across different teams. For example,
where the Fever extended above 50\% of their shots as Super Shots, it
was typical for them to score less than their opponent in the Super Shot
period; whereas when they used no Super Shots they typically outscored
their opponents. Other trends\ldots?

Nonetheless, the simulated margins within the Super Shot period,
irrrespective of the strategies used, were typically low - rarely
exceeding 1.5 to 2 points in a typical simulation. At most we suggest
that optimising the Super Shot proportions for a given team and opponent
may yield (on average) a 1 or 2 point gain each quarter. This may still
be beneficial for teams, as this could equate to 4 to 8 points across an
entire match. However, it is important to note that this is the average
+/- 95\% CIs, and hence it will not occur the same each time.
